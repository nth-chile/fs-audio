For adding an entry, set vars at the top of these scripts and run them (in this order):

scrapeSugarMegs.js <-- make sure no lengths are 0. this will stop the iteration. if this happens, check otu the identifiers folder. remove empties from build-smdb array.
build-smdb.js
pullDateFromTitle.js

Then check out all entries that don't have tracks `db.getCollection("bob-dylan").find({tracks: []})`

Check out all entries that don't have .mp3s `db.getCollection("bob-dylan").find({ tracks : { $not: { $elemMatch: { uri : { $regex : /.mp3$/ } } } } })`
I haven't had to do any conversions yet. But keep in mind this DB is shaped for archive.org entries only ..
